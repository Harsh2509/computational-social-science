                <p>The analysis of social media platforms to identify and report on ideological/political polarization is an important task that can help us better understand the nature of political discourse in online spaces. Political polarization is the divergence of political opinions, beliefs, attitudes, and stances between individuals and groups who hold opposing political views. <span class="highlighted">In this problem, we will analyze social media/platforms to identify and report the ideological/political polarization, which is the divergence of political opinions, beliefs, attitudes, and stances of political adversaries.</span></p>

                <h2>Detecting Biases in social media</h2>
                <p>Social media bias is a topic of growing concern as social media platforms play an increasingly important role in shaping public opinion and political discourse. Bias on social media platforms can manifest in a variety of ways, including algorithmic bias, user bias, and content bias. These biases can result in differential treatment of users based on their demographic characteristics, such as gender, income level, racial affinity, national identity, and age. <span class="highlighted"> In this problem, we will explore, analyze and report the social media bias along various dimensions such as: gender, income level, racial affinity, national identity, age etc. This will help our society to become more neutral in terms of social media uses.</span></p>

                <p>The impact of social media on mental health, particularly depression, has become a topic of growing concern in recent years. While social media platforms can provide many benefits, such as connecting people and facilitating social interactions, they can also have negative impacts on mental health, including increased feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression. <span class="highlighted">In this problem, we will analyze the impact of social media on mental health (Depression).

                <p>Detecting and addressing misinformation and fake news on social media has become a crucial issue in today's digital landscape. Misinformation can have serious consequences, including spreading false information and causing harm to individuals and society as a whole. Therefore, it is important to identify and address misinformation on social media platforms. <span class="highlighted">In this problem, we aim to detect the misinformation/fake news in social media.

                <p>Influence maximization is a problem in social network analysis that involves identifying a small set of influential nodes, known as seed nodes, that can maximize the spread of information or behavior in a social network. The goal of influence maximization is to identify the most influential nodes in a network in order to maximize the impact of a message or behavior. <span class="highlighted">Here, we can propose various techniques/ algorithms for  Influence maximization which can be defined as the problem of finding a small subset of nodes (seed nodes) in a social network that could maximize the spread of influence. </span> </p>
